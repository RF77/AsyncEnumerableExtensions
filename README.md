# AsyncEnumerableExtensions
Additional Extensions to the official System.Linq.Async, System.Interactive.Async libs, using also parts of the async-enumerable-dotnet library by David Karnok.

Due to conflicts, it's difficult to use the offical libs and async-enumerable-dotnet side by side. Therefore this library bases on additional parts of the async-enumerable-dotnet library in a way it can be used side by side.

Finally I add my own extensions, described here later.
